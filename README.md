# EHS-VEX
A github repository which allows VEX members to add their code in order to spark ideas with other coders.
Hello. Email stephenfaulkner0808@gmail.com in order to get access to the repository. 
When you get access please create a branch with your main person name on it to put in your code.
Some basic rules:
1. Do not change anyone else's code
2. If you want to add ideas or any critisisms please be respectful
3. Each year please tell the coders in your team about this since I cannot guarantee I will be here every year
4. DON"T STEAL! If you want to build upon others ideas you can but be sure to ask the person before hand. If you cannot ask the person because they don't attend EHS or aren't in TSA anymore it is free domain then.
5. Each year when the owner graduates please transfer ownership to a new person
